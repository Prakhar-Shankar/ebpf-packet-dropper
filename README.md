# ebpf-port-blocker

A minimal eBPF/XDP-based utility written in Go and C to **drop TCP packets** on a specific port (default: `4040`). Includes optional support to configure the port dynamically from user space.

---

## üîß Features

- Drops incoming TCP packets on a specified port (default: 4040)
- Lightweight and fast using XDP (eXpress Data Path)
- Optional: Set port dynamically from user space using BPF maps
- Written using eBPF and Go with `cilium/ebpf` or `libbpf` depending on approach
